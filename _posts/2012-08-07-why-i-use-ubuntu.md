title: Why I use Ubuntu
---

Exactly 6 months ago I wanted to build an osm (OpenStreetMap) server on a fedora virtual machine.

I had to install and configure too many stuff, but there was still something wrong,
I spent about a week to launch a gis system on fedora, but I could haven't done it,
and fedora really pissed me off, then I decided to try it on ubuntu,
hah, it was so simple on ubuntu.

Take a look at [Ubuntu tile server](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Ubuntu_tile_server).

(It was just a story of my working with fedora and ubuntu.)

It's not only the reason why I use ubuntu, I use ubuntu because it doesn't make me involved in such bullshits
(compiling libraries/applications that are not existed in the package manager etc)
and I use ubuntu because I prefer to spend my time on better things.
